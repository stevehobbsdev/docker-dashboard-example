# Docker Dashboard Example

This is the code repository for the "Create a Docker dashboard with Typescript, React and Socket.io" article on Auth0.

## Prerequisites

**Node 6.x**

**Webpack**

```
npm install -g webpack
```

**Typescript 2.x**

```
npm install -g typescript
```

Clone the project, then run:

```
npm install
npm link typescript
```

The sample interacts with Docker, so having the [native Docker tools](https://www.docker.com/) for your OS is required for the sample to be of any use. If you're looking for an image to play around with for the sample, feel free to use `elkdanger/express-app`:

`docker pull elkdanger/express-app`

## Running the sample

```
npm start
```
